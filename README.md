# Flask Web Hosting

Host your Flask web application online. 


1) Copy your git repo address (e.g. https://github.com/chrisjsimpson/flask-quickstart )
2) Press `Host my project`
3) Your python website will be hosted at `https://<username>-<reponame>.segfault.app`

p.s. this was a weekend project, treat it as such.
